The [Todo List block](https://richtabor.com/todo-list-block/) is a simple, editor-only block designed to quickly add tasks directly within the editor. Todo List makes it easy to keep track of publishing tasks, all in the context of a particular post.

You may also use it to add a publishing checklist to the post, such as using a headline analyzer, adding featured images, adding social images, etc.
